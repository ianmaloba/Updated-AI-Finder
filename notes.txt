One can create an account...even companies can create an account and then add their AI tools there.
Also when people add tags...we can list all tags and let the mark tne tags available...etc
In the form..let them add even logo ..etc, and then we can tell them that if they do not, we will have a default One
At the pricing tag, we can let then add tag..a decription..etc, theis way we can click learn more and a pop up for more info about pricing.

The blogs can be written by companies ...etc, or just any user. So in their profile...there are their tools and their blogs as well.
bug: if I search... and finish and use the back button on chrome...the spanner continues to rotate
Ensure one can visit each category or tool tag through the red heading of its table (when clicked) ...
Instead of the tools links there at all tool tags and all categories...we can have a modal to come up with details about the tool..
---details load including its logo, name, tags...etc, but no visit...we just have see more for detail page(basically like a cart)

- Ensure to truncate everything in all cards on the website/...expecially pricing...it is not truncated

- After search, we can add a feature to filter the results with price for example...highest prices and lowest etc...basically without
-----loading it again.

For blogs, we can also find a way for users to add blogs purely by pasting links from medium, hashnode ...
